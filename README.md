✨# Code-for-ETL-operations-on-Country-GDP-data
This project automates the extraction of semi-annual GDP data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) website using Python. The script scrapes and processes country-specific GDP figures (in billion USD, rounded to two decimal places), providing a reusable and efficient solution to update economic data.
